Faster Java Serialization classes.

<p>The classes in this package enable faster serialization by
generating bytecodes on the fly to serialize objects.

<p>When an object is serialized, its class is inspected and 
a class that implements the Serializer interface is generated.
This class is tailor made to serialize the fields of the given
object's class directly.

<p>To serialize objects to a ByteBuffer, all you have to do is 
use the <code>SerializationContext</code> class:
<pre>
	...
	SerializationContext context = new SerializationContext();
	ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
	context.serialize(myObject, buffer);
	...
</pre>
<p>Serializes <code>myObject</code>. Note that, in order to be
serialized, objects must implement <code>java.io.Serializable</code>

<p>To reconstruct the object, all you have to do is use the 
<code>DeserializationContext</code> class:

<pre>
	...
	DeserializationContext context = new DeserializationContext();
	MyObject reconstructedObject = (MyObject)context.deserialize(buffer);
	...
</pre>
<p>Reads the <code>reconstructedObject</code>. In the meantime, the data
in the ByteBuffer can easily be written to a file or sent through a network
using Java NIO.
